-- Prune PSCIS duplicates that remain

-- First, find all crossings on same stream within 5m of another
-- in the _prelim3 table

-- Then, by selecting DISTINCT ON blue line key and measure, and sorting,
-- we remove duplicate events, retaining (in order of priority)
--  - higher index status (1 REMEDIATED, 2 DESIGN, 3 ASSESSED)
--  - most recently assessed
--  - closest source point to stream
